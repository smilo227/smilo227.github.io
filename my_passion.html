				<p>A little more than a century separates these two flights. What impressive progress, don't you think ?</p>
				<h4>A little bit of history ...</h4>
				<h5>First flight ...</h5>
				<p>The Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, are aviation pioneers credited with inventing, building, and flying the first successful airplane. Their first flight was on December 17, 1903, just south of Kittyhawk, North Carolina.</p>
				<h5>A very big airplane ...</h5>
				<p>The first flight of the Airbus A380 was on April 25, 2005 on Toulouse-Blagnac airport. It's the third biggest airplane in the aviation history !</p><p>It can carry 615 passengers over a distance of about 15000km.</p><p>Unfortunately, the production of this airplane will stop on 2021, because of its too high development costs. It's a commercial failure for the Airbus company.</p>
				<h4>My experience</h4>
				<p>I've always been fascinated by these machines. These tons of metal flying at hundreds km/h, staying in the air, it's like magic. But it's only physic laws, as everyone knows.</p>
				<p>I would have liked to become a pilot, but I was not enough strong in math. However, during one hour with a monitor on my side, I lived the experience of flying on a motor glider, sort of hybrid between a glider and a tourist plane, on Grimbergen air field.</p><p>I took the commands during half an hour, and waw, this will be one of my best moment of my life !</p><p>That was much more exiting than my Flight Simulator computer game !<br>Full of sensations !</p><p>This is when I realized the futility of the problems remained on the ground.</p>
				<p>I don't have pictures of the motor glider I flew on, but this is what it's like:</p>
