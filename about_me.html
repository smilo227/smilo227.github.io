			<p>Here's a little exercice, just to create a small website talking about me.</p>
			<p>But sorry, I don't like to talk about myself, just because I think I'm not important. What is important to me is to do my best to make people happy. Only acts count and leave a mark, those who perform them only pass...</p>
<p>It is also important to me to leave the Earth as much as possible as I received it at my birth, which is not easy I must admit, but I try.</p>
<p>What does our lifespan on this billion-year-old planet represent? The equivalent of a thousandth of a second on a day? Not even. So why complicate things? My motto: life is too short to complicate it, so enjoy.</p>
<p>I prefer to let the mystery hang in the air and let people discover me as I am, with my qualities and my flaws. Those who know me then appreciate me at my fair value and not on base of what I could say or what people could think about me.</p>
<p>Just to illustrate how important I am, here is a picture of me:</p>
			</div>
			<figure>
				<img class="image-rounded responsive" src="img/portrait.jpg" alt="portrait of me"/>
				<figcaption class="image-rounded-caption">Just a little dust on Earth ...</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<div>
			<p>See what I mean? On the moment we see things a little higher, they seems sooooo small and unsignificant !</p>
			<p>That philosophy is naturally related to one of my biggest passion: <a href="my_passion.html" title="to my passion's page" target="_self">aviation</a>.</p>
			<p>What's better than fly in the air and let all problems on the ground ?</p>
